      <h2>Lester Family Vineyard</h2>
      <p>
                  Lester is a classic cold-climate location, with sandy, loamy soil.  The
          sandy soils are a result of the region's origin as a sea bed; geological
          activity associated with the San Andreas Fault pushed up the seabed,
          forming successive marine terraces (this is how the Santa Cruz
          Mountains were formed).  The vineyard's cold climate is due to heavy
          marine influence - it lies at about 600ft elevation, and is only 2-3 miles
          from the Pacific, so it gets plenty of fog during the summer.  Although
          the fog can bring challenges in reaching full ripeness in colder years, the
          marine influence allows for the slow and even grape development that
          makes cool-climate Pinot (and Syrah) so desirable.  Lester is managed by
          Prudy Foxx.  Prudy is well known in the Santa Cruz Mountains AVA, and
          her care and attention really show at this site. The vineyard is nearly
          dry farmed, being watered at most 2-3 times during the year, and then
          only for 4-6 hours.  This strict watering regime has remained in place
          throughout the recent drought, a remarkable feat not matched by many
          other sites.  The deep (30+ ft) root systems of the vines (planted in
          1998) and the uniformity of the sandy, loamy soils certainly help.
          Although not certified organic, this site has never seen herbicides of
          any kind, and the winter cover crop (usually barley and bell beans)
          slowly turns golden as summer progresses.  The quality of this site and
          Prudy's careful farming really came out in my first two Lester vintages.
          The 2012 Pinot Noir (94 pts) and 2013 Pinot Noir (94 pts) both quickly
          sold out.

      <h2>Spring Hill Vineyard</h2>
      <p>
              2010 was our first vintage working with Karen and Chris London of
      Spring Hill Ranch and Vineyard.  Their vineyard is a west-facing hillside,
      sandy loam site tucked between Petaluma and the northern tip of Point
      Reyes.  Right in the center of the Petalum Gap, it is cool and windy
      during the growing season.  It is so windy, the Londons have found that
      leaf pulling in the fruit zone isn't necessary; the wind shreds the
      canopy enough to get dappled light on the fruit.  On a perfect day (for
      growing Pinot Noir) the temperature reaches the high 70s or low 80s
      with fog at night.  There are currently 20 acres planted with Swan, 115,
      Pommard, 2A, 667, 777, Calera clones.  The vines were planted in 2001,
      2002 and 2003.  The Londons run Scottish Highland Beef cattle on their
      adjacent acreage and farm the grapes primarily by themselves
      composting and hand-pulling weeds.

      <h2>Flocchini Vineyard</h2>
      <p>
                Scott got a call from a fellow winemaker during the harvest of 2008.  His
        friend knew of a promising Syrah vineyard, in the Sonoma Coast
        appellation, that still had fruit to sell.  After talking with the Flocchinis
        we jumped at the chance and took a ton of their Syrah grapes, clones
        Noir and 877.  The Flocchini family had traditionally run dairy cows on
        the property but planted a portion of their property to grapes in 2002.
        The Petaluma Gap growing region is fast becoming known for producing
        balanced, delicious cool climate Syrah.  The vineyard is located along
        Old Lakeville Road   Number 3, southeast of Petaluma.  The block I take
        is on a gentle west facing slope above the Petaluma River.  Flocchini
        uses stored surface water to irrigate during the growing season and
        with the current drought it has been hit or miss with collecting enough
        water during the wet season.

      <h2>Tondré Grapefield</h2>
      <p>
              The vineyard is located in the Santa Lucia Highlands.  SLH is known
      more for Pinot Noir but the cool, coastal influence from Monterrey Bay
      is ideal for Riesling (and Syrah!), too.  Owner Joe Alarid planted the
      Riesling vines in 2006 just as other growers were pulling out large blocks
      of Riesling from the AVA.  He has 104 acres total in vines and just 3
      acres of Riesling.  Elevation is 360 to 400 ft above the dry Arroyo Seco
      riverbed and the soil is chualar sandy loam.  The vineyard received just
      4 inches of rain during the 2013/2014 wet season (average for the site is
      12 inches) so Joe had to use his drip irrigation system during the
      growing season for our 2014 Tondré Riesling.  His water comes from
      wells on his property and he feels the water table in the area is being
      used sustainably.  He planted the vine rows in a north-south
      orientation to get more even sun exposure on both sides of the vines
      (traditionally the rows have mostly gone east-west in SLH vineyards).
      After bloom he opens up the canopy with leaf pulling around the fruit
      zone and tends to drop fruit after veraison to lighten the crop load and
      we pick the fruit between 21 and 22 Brix and greater than 3.00 pH.
